## Introduction:
- In the ever-evolving world of finance and technology, I've created a cutting-edge web application that empowers users to - learn and practice stock trading without the risks associated with real money investments. Leveraging the power of Python's yfinance library and the predictive capabilities of deep learning LSTM layers, this platform provides users with a comprehensive learning experience. Let's delve into the various features and components that make this web app a remarkable tool for aspiring stock traders.

### Fetching and Analyzing Stock Data:
- Upon entering a stock name, the web app harnesses the yfinance Python library to fetch historical stock data. This historical data serves as the foundation for training a sophisticated deep learning model. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, the model gains the ability to capture intricate patterns and trends in stock prices. This process equips users with an insightful glimpse into the complexities of the stock market, fostering a deeper understanding of price movements.

### Predictive Modeling:
- The heart of the web app lies in its predictive modeling capabilities. The fetched historical data is employed to train the LSTM model, enabling it to make informed predictions about future stock prices. This predictive power is not only a valuable educational tool but also provides users with a firsthand experience of the challenges and potential rewards of stock trading. Model trains itself for every stock data and predicts charts. It takes around 10 seconds to do all the things.

### Visualizing Predicted Prices:
- To enhance user engagement and comprehension, the web app dynamically generates charts that visualize the predicted stock prices. This visual representation serves as a valuable learning aid, allowing users to compare their predictions against actual price movements and gain insights into the factors influencing stock price fluctuations.
